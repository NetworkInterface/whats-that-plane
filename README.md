# What's that plane?!
A Home Assistant integration made for my partner who enjoys looking up flight information, specifically for planes that pass by her office window.

The unique part about this integration is that it will simulate a cone of vision in a specified direction and only report back flight information within the FOV. This cone of vision acts as the filter for returned flight information rather than an entire circle radius from the defined home position (though this is also still possible by setting your FOV cone to 360°).

Once dialled in, you or your partner can also scream **"WHAT'S THAT PLANE?!"** every time a plane passes by and view a bunch of interesting stats while it's in line of sight. This can quickly become out of hand and you may start collecting sightings of planes' shiny custom livery variants.

The flight data is pulled using the unofficial SDK for FlightRadar24; [FlightRadarAPI](https://github.com/JeanExtreme002/FlightRadarAPI).

The exposed sensor information can be used to create interesting dashboard cards such as the example markdown card below:

![Example card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8bither0/whats-that-plane/main/example.jpg)

See [Adding visible flight information card to your dashboard](#Adding-visible-flight-information-card-to-your-dashboard) below for the template code to add this card to your own dashboard.

## Configuration
To initially configure the integration, define the information below. This can be reconfigured via configuration entry options after initial setup:

| Option                              | Required | Example value                     | Description |
| :-------------------                | :------: | :-----------:                     | :---------- |
| `location_name`                     | ❌       | `Home`                            | A friendly name for your defined coordinates. This will be appended to the integration entry in the format `Visible Flights (Home)`. If empty, the integration entry will simply be called `Visible Flights`. This is useful when defining multiple entries. |
| `latitude`                          | ✅       | `51.5285262`                      | The latitude of your viewing location. This will default to the coordinates defined in your [homeassistant.local:8123/config/zone](http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/zone). |
| `longitude`                         | ✅       | `-0.2663999`                      | The longitude of your viewing location. This will default to the coordinates defined in your [homeassistant.local:8123/config/zone](http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/zone). |
| `radius_km`                         | ✅       | `5`                               | The radius distance boundary from your current location. e.g. `5` = 5km |
| `facing_direction`                  | ✅       | `0`                               | The degree bearing of the viewing direction. e.g. `0` = North, `90` = East, `180` = South, `270` = West. |
| `fov_cone`                          | ✅       | `90`                              | The number of degrees the field of view cone should be. |
| `update_interval`                   | ✅       | `10`                              | The number of seconds between each poll for flight information. |
| `filter_flight_altitude_ft_minimum` | ❌       | `0`                               | The minimum flight altitude in feet for flights to be recorded. |
| `filter_flight_altitude_ft_maximum` | ❌       | `60000`                           | The maximum flight altitude in feet for flights to be recorded. |
| `hold_flight_data_seconds`          | ❌       | `0`                               | The total number of seconds to keep a flight's data after it leaves your field of view. This can act as a grace period for when you aren't able to view relevant data before the flight leaves your FOV cone. |
| `historic_flights_max_count`        | ❌       | `0`                               | The total number of past flights to store in history. Can be used to show x number of flights that have recently left the FOV cone, useful for displaying "What was that plane?!" in case you miss it. See [Viewing historic flight information](#Viewing-historic-flight-information) for an example of how this can be utilised. |
| `distance_units`                    | ❌       | `metric (kilometres (km))`        | The unit of measurement to record flight distance in. |
| `altitude_units`                    | ❌       | `imperial (feet (ft))`            | The unit of measurement to record flight altitude in. |
| `speed_units`                       | ❌       | `imperial (miles per hour (mph))` | The unit of measurement to record flight speed in. |

> 💡 **TIP**: To make the initial configuration process easier, you can use the map card to easily visualise your FOV cone settings while you adjust the initial settings. See [Visualising recorded flights on a map card](#Visualising-recorded-flights-on-a-map-card) for more information.

After configuring the integration, a new sensor named `sensor.visible_flights` will be created. This will update at the frequency defined by the option `update_interval` and list flights visible within the defined field of view or additionally store flights that have recently left the defined field of view if the setting `historic_flights_max_count` is set to 1 or more. The exposed sensor information can be used to create a variety of interesting dashboard cards. See [Adding visible flight information card to your dashboard](#Adding-visible-flight-information-card-to-your-dashboard) for more information.

## Adding visible flight information card to your dashboard
The template code required to achieve the card shown in the screenshot above can be found below. To create the card in dashboards that you have control over and are able to add cards to:
1. Click the pencil icon in the top right corner to `Edit dashboard`.
2. Click the `Add card` button in the bottom right corner.
3. Search for and click on the `Manual` card type.
4. Copy and paste the code below into the code text field.
5. Click `Save`.
6. Click `Done` in the top right corner.

> If you'd like to extend this card to show historic flight data of flights that have recently left your FOV cone, complete this section first then ensure that your configuration setting `historic_flights_max_count` is 1 or more and move onto [Viewing historic flight information](#Viewing-historic-flight-information).

> If you haven't changed the default name of the sensor, you should simply be able to copy and paste the code below and it should work with no changes required. Otherwise, please find and replace your sensor name before pasting (Default: `sensor.visible_flights`):

## Viewing historic flight information
If your configuration setting for `historic_flights_max_count` is set to 1 or more, you can utilise the `historic_flights` attribute to view a log of flights that have left your defined FOV cone. This can be especially useful in situations where you just miss a plane but are still curious about what it was so instead of asking "What's that plane?!" you're left asking "What **was** that plane?!".

After you've already configured your main dashboard card (see [Adding visible flight information card to your dashboard](#Adding-visible-flight-information-card-to-your-dashboard)), you can extend this to show historic flights using the code below. Simply copy and paste it after the code for the existing card.

This section basically clones the existing card but only shows it for historic flights. The only real change is the addition of a last seen time on the title line for each flight.

**N.B.** It's important to note that when a plane leaves your defined FOV cone, its flight information will stop updating as the integration stops tracking the flight at this point. Stats are correct up to the moment the flight leaves the FOV cone, at which point the data is frozen.

## Visualising recorded flights on a map card
It's possible to visualise recorded flights and their flight trails on a map card to achieve the map card shown in the video demonstration below. This is a great way to make your dashboard more interactive and visualise where flights have come from and where they're going to. Or, simply use the map as a helper when initially configuring your FOV cone settings:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43a910b3-c2c1-41b1-8d23-74874c7dbaf3

> ⚠️ Ensure that you have at least one configured entry before trying to use the map card.

To add the map card to dashboards that you have control over and are able to add cards to:
1. Click the pencil icon in the top right corner to `Edit dashboard`.
2. Click the `Add card` button in the bottom right corner.
3. Search for and click on the `Manual` card type.
4. Copy and paste the code below into the code text field.
5. Click `Save`.
6. Click `Done` in the top right corner.

> If you haven't changed the default name of the sensor, you should simply be able to copy and paste the code below and it should work with no changes required. Otherwise, please find and replace your sensor name before pasting (Default: `sensor.visible_flights`):

```
square: true
type: grid
cards:
  - type: custom:whats-that-plane-map
    entity: sensor.visible_flights
columns: 1
grid_options:
  columns: full
```

> 💡 **TIP**: To make the initial configuration process easier, you can use the map card to easily visualise your FOV cone settings.
>
> ![Example map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8bither0/whats-that-plane/main/example_map.jpg)
>
> Once the map card is added to your dashboard, simply change your configuration settings then refer back to the dashboard card to view how your edits change the FOV cone **(you will need to refresh your dashboard page to force an update due to caching)**.

**N.B.** It's important to note that when a plane leaves your defined FOV cone, its flight information will stop updating as the integration stops tracking the flight at this point. Stats are correct up to the moment the flight leaves the FOV cone, at which point the data is frozen.
